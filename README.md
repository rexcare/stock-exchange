# ACME Stock Exchange
This is a very dumbed down implementation of how a stock exchange works. I have no financial background, so I'm open to suggestions on logic used, variable/class names. Feel free to point out any mistakes.
## Get Started
```
npm install
npm run build
npm run test
```
## To-do
 - UI
 - Persistence
 - Different types of orders (only limit orders are supported as of now)
 - Cancelling orders
 - Roles (Traders, Admins)
 - Leverage
 - Automatic square-off
